# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

ChartMyFitness

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A interactive website that enables you to chart and log your workout history and possibly compare with friends?

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Our software will include different Google Maps API, Google Calendar API, and other forms of integration that allow us to alert our user to remind
them to work out and log their amounts of hours or miles ran (possibly using Twilio).

## If planning to combine CS50's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to CS50, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A website that a user can sign up for to help them log their workouts and allowing them to use a map interface to chart those workouts as well as log them.
Also, the website will track the progress and aim to keep the user on progress to a goal.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be a website that also enables users to have a tab where they can view a map that has different gyms, parks, trails, physical therapists, atheltic stores near them
so anything that could be useful to assist them in their workouts. Making it so that the user could have friends and they could compare their progress. Also, having them input certain information
and as a result of that information the website could provide them with suggested diets/workout based on a baseline analysis.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome I can think of is a clean cut interface that allows users to compare their miles run with their friends, while also enabling Google Calendar API that accurately updates that calendar
with workout specific tasks. Also thinking of some other features, possibly a way I could request or challenge one of my friends to a solo challenge. Additionally, having a feature that alerts the user to workout/log their miles.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Definitely will need to continue working with Python and figure out the best API integration methods.
Additionally, will need to figure out what the best method to create the "friends" list and get that working.
Need to workout diet guides, workout plans for certain genders/weights etc.
On the CS Side, we will need to creatively and continuously think of new features to add and try and get them instilled as early as possible and be ready
to google and try out different ways to implement things across the server eventually.
Also, think it would be great it we could remind/alert the users regarding different friend/goal/daily notifications so will need to research possibly using Twilio as soon as possible.
